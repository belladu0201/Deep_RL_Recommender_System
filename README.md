## Motivation
The rapid expansion of the e-commerce industry has led to an overwhelming amount of choices for consumers, making it increasingly difficult for customers to find relevant products that fullfill their preferences and needs. To solve this issue, personalized product recommendations have become an important aspect of enhancing user experience and ensuring customer satisfaction. Most importantly, increasing the sales and prestiage of the companies to achieve double win. As a result, there is a growing demand for innovative and effective product recommendation systems that can adapt to users' preferences in real-time and provide accurate recommendations. 

## Goal
This project aims to explore recommender systems by implementing algorithms into datasets, specifically focusing on session-based and sequential recommendation techniques that can be utilized in e-commerce use cases. By experimenting with different methods, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), we strive to improve the performance of recommendation systems and ultimately contribute to an enhanced user experience in the e-commerce domain.
